/*Hey!  So I've been doing some research about animating different Elements.
This is what I've learned so far.  I hope that it helps you be more creative.
CSS is super dope!!  This is just barely the tip of the iceberg too.
As you can tell, there is no bootstap assisting me.  Just CSS.  FYI.  The .js file
does not work.  Still working out the kinks about that.  It was suppose to be
a click function, but the stupid thing is not working.  Take not of the :hover in CSS.
So yea, just reverse engineer this
good good CSS and you should be gucci mane!
I hope this will inspire you.

:D

with love from bluff
